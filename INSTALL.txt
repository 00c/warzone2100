To install, use autotools, or type:

make -f makefile.raw		[this makes a DEBUG build (default)]
make -f makefile.raw MODE=prod  [this makes a RELEASE build]

This should work for both linux & minGW.

Then once it has compiled, copy the warzone executable
to the data directory (where ever you unrared 2.0.2.3-data.rar to),
then
./warzone -window 800x600 [for linux]
warzone -window 800x600 [for windows using command window]

Please read the README.txt file for other command line options.
