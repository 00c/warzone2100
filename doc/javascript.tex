\title{Warzone2100 JavaScript Scripting API}

\section{Introduction}

Warzone2100 contains a scripting language for implementing AIs, campaigns and some of the game
rules. It uses JavaScript, so you should become familiar with this language before proceeding
with this document. A number of very good guides to JavaScript exist on the Internet.

The following hard-coded files exist for game rules that use this API:

\begin{description}
	\item[multiplay/skirmish/rules.js] Basic game rules - base setup, starting research, winning and losing.
	\item[multiplay/script/scavfact.js] Scavenger AI. This script is active if scavengers are.
\end{description}

For ordinary AI scripts, these are controlled using '.ai' files that are present in the 'multiplayer/skirmish'
directory. Here is an example of an '.ai' file that defines an AI implemented using this API:

\begin{verbatim}
	[AI]
	name = "Semperfi JS"
	js = semperfi.js
\end{verbatim}

It references a '.js' JavaScript file that needs to be in the same directory as the '.ai' file. The code in
this file is accessed through specially named functions called 'events'. These are defined below. An event
is expected to carry out some computation then return immediately. The game is on hold while an event is processed,
so do not do too many things at once, or else the player will experience stuttering.

All global variables are saved when the game is saved. However, do not try to keep JavaScript objects that are
returned from API functions defined here around in the global scope. They are not meant to be used this way, and
bad things may happen. If you need to keep static arrays around, it is better to keep them locally defined to a
function, as they will then not be saved and loaded.

One error that it is easy to make upon initially learning JavaScript and using this API, is to try to use
the 'for (... in ...)' construct to iterate over an array of objects. This does not work! Instead, use code
like the following:

\begin{lstlisting}
var droidlist = enumDroid(me, DROID_CONSTRUCT);
for (var i = 0; i < droidlist.length; i++)
{
	var droid = droidlist[i];
	...
}
\end{lstlisting}

The above code gets a list of all your construction droids, and iterates over them one by one.

The droid object that you receive here has multiple properties that can be accessed to learn more about it. 
These propertie are read-only, and cannot be changed. In fact, objects that you get are just a copies of 
game state, and do not give any access to changing the game state itself.

Any value written in ALL_CAPS_WITH_UNDERSCORES are enums, special read-only constants defined by the
game.

\section{Common Objects}

Some objects are described under the functions creating them. The following objects are produced by
multiple functions and widely used throughout, so it is better to learn about them first.
