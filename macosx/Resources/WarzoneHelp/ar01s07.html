Rearming Pads</a>, otherwise, they won’t be able to reload ammo.</p><p>Before you produce a VTOL unit, you must design it. VTOLs are designed the same
way as regular units — simply select <span class="emphasis"><em>VTOL propulsion</em></span> — but use slightly
different weapons (more on that later).</p><p>VTOLs can only be built at VTOL Factories. VTOL factories can be upgraded with
factory modules — there’s no need to research a separate "VTOL factory
module".</p></div><div class="section" title="7.2. Moving"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="_moving"></a>7.2. Moving</h3></div></div></div><p>After producing a VTOL from a VTOL Factory, it will fly and land on the rally
point. VTOLs can be ordered to move and attack like any regular unit. Although
they will fly over water and cliffs, they can’t land on them.</p></div><div class="section" title="7.3. Attacking"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="_attacking"></a>7.3. Attacking</h3></div></div></div><p>VTOL weapons differ drastically from the norm.</p><p>To attack with a VTOL, select it and click an enemy like normal. However, you
may have noticed the white ammo bar below its health bar as you start
attacking.</p><p>Unlike ground units, which reload automatically, VTOLs carry a limited amount
of ammo. Once that ammo runs out, the VTOL can’t attack until it refuels. A
VTOL out of ammo will automatically find a VTOL rearming pad to rearm and
repair itself (and will resume attacking once fully rearmed), or it can be
manually rearmed by selecting it and clicking on a rearming pad.</p><p>VTOLs will not attack anything automatically. However, by selecting a VTOL and
alt+clicking on an area, a VTOL will patrol the area between its current
location and the clicked location, and attack anything in the vicinity.
Alternatively, they can be assigned to VTOL strike towers and VTOL CB towers,
which will cause them to function similarly to <a class="link" href="ar01s15.html" title="15. Artillery and Sensors">artillery assigned to sensor towers</a>.</p></div><div class="section" title="7.4. VTOL weapons"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="_vtol_weapons"></a>7.4. VTOL weapons</h3></div></div></div><p>Most weapons have a VTOL equivalent, which does approximately twice as much
damage, but has limited ammo. VTOL versions of regular weapons, like cyborgs,
do not need to be researched separately.</p><p>In addition to VTOL versions of ground-based direct weapons, VTOLs can also use
<span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="images/www.png" alt="URL" /></span> <a class="ulink" href="http://guide.wz2100.net/w/#vtolbombs" target="_top">bomb weapons</a>.
These weapons are the equivalent of artillery, and are very powerful.</p></div><div class="section" title="7.5. Defending against VTOLs"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="_defending_against_vtols"></a>7.5. Defending against VTOLs</h3></div></div></div><p>VTOLs are not ground-based units, so most ground weapons cannot hit them. They
an only be hit by either anti-air (often abbreviated AA) (can only hit air) or
versatile (can hit air or ground) weapons.</p><p>There are only a few weapons that are versatile: machineguns, lasers, and
Mini-Rocket Pod. Rockets and missiles are also versatile, but only when mounted
on a cyborg or VTOL. In addition to being uncommon, versatile weapons do not do
as much damage to VTOLs as dedicated anti-air, so having some AA is
recommended.</p><p>There are three types of dedicated AA. In order of powerfulness, they are: Flak
(Hurricane, Cyclone, Whirlwind), SAM (Avenger, Vindicator), and Stormbringer.</p></div><div class="section" title="7.6. Other orders"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="_other_orders"></a>7.6. Other orders</h3></div></div></div><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Patrol</em></span>: In the Unit Orders box (right-click, remember?), there are a couple of
new icons. Patrol will do the same thing as alt+clicking — move back and forth
between its current location and the clicked location, and attack anything near
its path, refueling when they need to before returning to defending.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Circle</em></span>: In the Unit Orders box, next to Patrol, is the Circle button. Click it
and then click an area of ground, and the selected VTOLs will take off and fly
in a circle above the selected point. Like Patrol, they will attack anything
that gets nearby, and refuel automatically.</p></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr /><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ar01s06.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"> </td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="ar01s08.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top"> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table></div></body></html>
